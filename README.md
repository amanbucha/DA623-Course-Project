# Polynomial Analysis Project

This project explores various aspects of polynomials and their bases, including Vandermonde polynomials, Legendre polynomials, and Chebyshev polynomials. It includes Python scripts for computing polynomial coefficients, generating polynomial plots, and explaining the theoretical concepts behind different polynomial bases.

## Overview

Polynomials are mathematical expressions consisting of variables and coefficients, raised to non-negative integer powers. They are widely used in various fields, including mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science.

### Polynomial Bases

Polynomial bases are sets of polynomials that form a basis for a vector space of polynomials. They are used for polynomial interpolation, curve fitting, and approximation.

- **Vandermonde Polynomial Bases**: These bases are derived from the Vandermonde matrix, which is constructed from a set of data points.
- **Legendre Polynomial Bases**: Legendre polynomials are orthogonal polynomials defined on the interval [-1, 1]. They are commonly used in approximation and solving differential equations.
- **Chebyshev Polynomial Bases**: Chebyshev polynomials are orthogonal polynomials defined on the interval [-1, 1]. They have properties that make them useful for approximation and numerical analysis.

## Scripts

The project includes Python scripts for:

- Computing coefficients of polynomials using different polynomial bases.
